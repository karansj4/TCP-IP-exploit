In this lab, we performed an SYN Flooding attack on a victim machine using netwox 76, causing a denial of service on the server. Additionally, we performed a TCP RST attack using Netwox 78 and Scapy to disconnect the telnet and ssh connection between the server and the victim, again causing disruption in availability. We even performed the TCP RST attack when the victim was connected to YouTube to demonstrate the extensive usability of the attack and its ability to work on video streaming applications.
Next, we performed a TCP session hijacking attack, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim and continuing their session. This was done with the help of netwox 40 and Scapy. The IP packets were analyzed and manipulated via tcpdump and Wireshark to perform the attack. Lastly, we created a reserve shell using TCP hijacking, allowing the attacker to execute commands remotely as the victim.
